As a service to the X-ray testing and Computer Vision communities, we collected more than 21.100 X-ray images for the development, testing, and evaluation of image analysis and computer vision algorithms. The images are organized in this public database called GDXray+: The GRIMA X-ray database (GRIMA is the name of our Machine Intelligence Group at the Department of Computer Science of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile). The X-ray images included in GDXray+ can be used free of charge, for research and educational purposes only. Redistribution and commercial use is prohibited. Any researcher reporting results which use this database should acknowledge the GDXray+ database by citing:

GDXray includes five groups of images, they can be downloaded from the following links:

- [Castings](http://dmery.sitios.ing.uc.cl/images/GDXray/Castings.zip) (314 MB)
- [Welds](http://dmery.sitios.ing.uc.cl/images/GDXray/Welds.zip) <sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> (209 MB) 
- [Baggage](http://dmery.sitios.ing.uc.cl/images/GDXray/Baggages.zip) (3.048 GB)
- [Nature](http://dmery.sitios.ing.uc.cl/images/GDXray/Nature.zip) (192 MB)
- [Settings](http://dmery.sitios.ing.uc.cl/images/GDXray/Settings.zip) (73 MB)

Each group has several series, and each series several X-ray images. For instance, series C0001 contains 72 X-ray images of an aluminum casting (wheel). See the mentioned paper for description.
