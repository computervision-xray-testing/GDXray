As a service to the X-ray testing and Computer Vision communities, we collected more than 21.100 X-ray images for the development, testing, and evaluation of image analysis and computer vision algorithms. The images are organized in this public database called GDXray+: The GRIMA X-ray database (GRIMA is the name of our Machine Intelligence Group at the Department of Computer Science of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile). The X-ray images included in GDXray+ can be used free of charge for research and educational purposes only. Redistribution and commercial use are prohibited. Any researcher reporting results that use this database should acknowledge the GDXray+ database by citing:

GDXray includes five groups of images, which can be downloaded from the following links:

- [Castings](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5e7m31ri5grvnl7kxt8mx/Castings.zip?rlkey=zetfg5g337d2ip265a16rcviw&st=gjub7hr3) (314 MB)

Each group has several series, and each series has several X-ray images. For instance, series C0001 contains 72 X-ray images of an aluminum casting (wheel). See the mentioned paper for a description.
